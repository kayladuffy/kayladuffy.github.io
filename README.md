Web Dev Bootcamp - Project 1
June 8, 2020

This project is intended to function as an online website for a typical boutique.

You have your "Home" page which contains a picture and brief (fake) story about the shop. 
A "Tees" page which displays the t-shirt content available for purchase.
A "Jewelry" page which displays the jewelry content available for purchase.
A "Sale" page which displays items on sale. 
And a "Contact Us" page which has a carousel of product, contact info and a form for shoppers to fill out (connected to formspree.io)

I used: HTML, CSS and Javascript

Ideas for future improvement: 

1. Add a shopping bag capability
2. Add a wish list capability
3. Add quick view feature
4. Add backend inventory and calculations to enable sales
5. Add more user-friendly formatting for better and more seemless site exploration
